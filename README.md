# PoAh 2.0: AI-empowered Dynamic Authentication based Adaptive Blockchain Consensus for IoMT-Edge Workflow

Welcome to the official code repository for the research paper "PoAh 2.0: AI-empowered Dynamic Authentication based Adaptive Blockchain Consensus for IoMT-Edge Workflow". This repository contains the implementation details of the PoAh 2.0 consensus algorithm, designed to enhance security and efficiency in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) domains, particularly focusing on eHealth applications.

## Abstract

Our research introduces PoAh 2.0, an advancement in the Proof of Authentication (PoAh) consensus algorithm, customized for resource-constrained IoT devices. This iteration incorporates Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the block creator node level, facilitating dynamic authentication based on the sensitivity of data within each block. This approach ensures a high level of security and integrity for transactions within the IoMT-Edge workflow. Through a case study in an IoMT-based eHealth scenario, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our AI-enabled dynamic authentication mechanism, setting new standards for block validation and security.

## Blockchain Capabilities Highlighted

- **Dynamic Authentication in Blockchain:** Introduces a novel dynamic authentication mechanism, adapting security protocols based on the sensitivity of data within each block.

- **AI-Enabled Data Sensitivity Analysis:** Employs AI at the block creator node level for the assessment of data sensitivity, which informs the security measures applied to each block.

- **Enhancement of Data Privacy and Security:** Significantly improves data privacy and security in eHealth scenarios through the management of metadata by AI and restricted data access.

- **Practical Application and Validation:** Validates the model through a practical application case study in an IoMT-based eHealth scenario, demonstrating its viability and effectiveness.
