# PoAh 2.0: AI-Empowered Dynamic Authentication-Based Adaptive Blockchain Consensus for IoMT-Edge Workflow

Welcome to the official code repository for the research paper **"PoAh 2.0: AI-Empowered Dynamic Authentication-Based Adaptive Blockchain Consensus for IoMT-Edge Workflow."** This repository contains the implementation details of the PoAh 2.0 consensus algorithm, designed to enhance security and efficiency in **Internet of Things (IoT)** and **Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)** domains, particularly focusing on **eHealth** applications.

## Abstract

Our research introduces **PoAh 2.0**, an advancement of the Proof of Authentication (PoAh) consensus algorithm, specifically customized for resource-constrained IoT devices. This version integrates **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** at the block creator node level, enabling **dynamic authentication** based on data sensitivity. This approach ensures high-level security and integrity for transactions within the **IoMT-Edge** workflow. A case study on an IoMT-based eHealth scenario demonstrates the effectiveness of our AI-enabled dynamic authentication mechanism, setting new standards for block validation and security.

abstract = {This paper introduces a significant advancement in the Proof of Authentication (PoAh) consensus algorithm, designed specifically for resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Building upon the foundations of PoAh consensus, this enhanced iteration, known as PoAh 2.0, integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the block creator node level. This novel approach allows for the generation of block transactions embedded with AI-determined sensitivity and other applicable transaction-related metadata, a pioneering concept in this domain. The verifier node, a trusted entity, is tasked with verifying incoming blocks, utilizing the block header and its metadata information to determine authenticity while preserving the privacy of the content of the block’s data. A core innovation of PoAh 2.0 is its dynamic authentication mechanism, which adapts to the sensitivity level of the data within each block, behaving in an adaptive way based on the situation. AI plays a crucial role in this process, ensuring the block’s integrity and security are maintained. To demonstrate the efficacy of this advanced AI-enabled PoAh 2.0 consensus, we conducted a case study in an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-based eHealth scenario. The results from this study reveal that our developed dynamic authentication technique not only significantly enhances the original PoAh version but also establishes a new benchmark in block validation and security for eHealth applications. The integration of AI and improved dynamic authentication, calibrated to the security needs of each block, marks a novel and significant stride in blockchain research. This development not only enriches the current understanding of blockchain applications in IoT, but also sets a new direction for future research in secure and efficient blockchain implementations in the IoMT-Edge centric eHealth landscape.}
